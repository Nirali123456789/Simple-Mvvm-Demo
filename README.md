MVVM Demo App (Android)
This is a simple Android app demonstrating the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architectural pattern. MVVM is a design pattern that separates the concerns of an app into three components: Model, View, and ViewModel. This approach promotes a more organized and maintainable codebase by decoupling the user interface from the business logic.

Features
The MVVM Demo App includes the following features:

User Login: Allows users to log in using their credentials.
User Profile: Displays the user's profile information once logged in.
To-Do List: Provides a to-do list where users can add, update, and delete tasks.
Task Status: Tracks the status of each task (e.g., completed, pending).
Requirements
To run the MVVM Demo App, you will need the following:

Android Studio installed on your development machine.
An Android emulator or a physical Android device to run the app.
Internet connectivity to fetch user profile data.
Installation
Clone the repository from GitHub:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/mvvm-demo-app.git
Open the project in Android Studio.

Build and run the app on the emulator or a physical Android device.

Architecture
The MVVM Demo App follows the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architectural pattern:

Model: Represents the data and business logic of the application. It includes entities such as user data and tasks.

View: The user interface components responsible for displaying information and capturing user input. It includes Activities, Fragments, and UI elements.

ViewModel: Acts as an intermediary between the Model and the View. It contains the presentation logic, fetches data from the Model, and prepares it for display in the View.

Folder Structure
The app's folder structure is organized as follows:

lua
